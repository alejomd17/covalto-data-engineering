This repository contains my solution to Covalto's Data Engineering Challenge. 
The solution addresses all three problems presented in the challenge using appropriate technologies and architectures.

## Challenge Problems, how to navigate
### 1. For "The High Level Problem" - Architecture Design:
   
  Solution: [architecture.md](./architecture.md)

  This solution presents a comprehensive Azure-based architecture to address:
* Customer Behavior Data Visualization for analysts
* Risk Assessment for home buyers seeking mortgages
* Real-time Fraud Monitoring systems

### 2. For "The Low Level Problem" - Directed Acyclic Graph technical implementation

Solution:  [directed_acyclic_graph.ipynb](./directed_acyclic_graph.ipynb)

Jupyter Notebook containing the complete implementation for:
* Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) processing
* Path counting and cost calculation algorithms
* Vertex insertion with constraints validation
* Comprehensive test cases and validation

### 3. For "The Scenario Problem" - Team collaboration approach

Solution: [scenario.md](./scenario.md)

Professional approach to handling cross-team dependencies and mock service issues, including:

* Conflict resolution strategies
* Technical implementation plans
* Expected responses and counter-proposals
* Long-term prevention measures
